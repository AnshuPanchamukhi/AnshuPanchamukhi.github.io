       AI, AI, AI… It’s everywhere now! From our daily interactions to enhancing work-related communications, from self-driving cars to groundbreaking research analysis, the presence of AI has permeated almost every aspect of our lives. The rapid expansion of AI certainly raises important questions about our future—questions regarding authenticity, safety, job security, its impact on youth, and so much more.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-4">
       Is AI truly a greater threat than we realize, or are we simply overreacting?
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
       In my view, any invention that comes with ethical concerns is indicative of its power. This pattern has been evident throughout history with nearly all significant inventions. Consider Alfred Nobel and dynamite, Fritz Haber with the Haber Process, the team behind the atomic bomb including Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and J. Robert Oppenheimer, or Edward Jenner with vaccines. Fast forward to more recent developments like the Internet, gene editing, and now AI and automation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-4">
       When it comes to job security, I don’t believe AI will lead to mass unemployment; rather, it will impact specific roles. Those whose work revolves around repetitive tasks may find their positions at risk, as automation can streamline these processes. However, the group most likely to be affected by the rise of AI and automation will be individuals who lack familiarity with these technologies.
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
       That’s why I firmly believe that basic education about AI should be integrated into school curriculums. While we can’t stop AI from penetrating every field and transforming them, we can equip the next generation with the knowledge to adapt and mitigate its negative side effects. By teaching students the fundamentals of AI and its applications, we’ll be instilling a vital skill for their future success in an evolving job market.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-4">
       Ultimately, it comes down to one crucial point: any invention can potentially pose a threat if not used responsibly. The future of humanity rests in how we choose to harness technologies like artificial intelligence. It can help us automate mundane tasks, conduct detailed market analyses, and improve overall efficiency. On the flip side, it can also facilitate hacking, produce malicious software, and be misused in ways that could harm the youth and society at large.
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
       Let’s choose to wield this power wisely. After all, if previous generations of scientists hadn’t approached their creations with caution, our world might look very different today.
